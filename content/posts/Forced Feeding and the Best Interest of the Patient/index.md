On August 16, the Court of Protection handed down the judgment of Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust v AB [2020] EWCOP 40. Mrs Justice Roberts reasoned that it was not in the best interests of the patient  (AB) to be force-fed, even though this would likely result in her death.

One question before the court was whether AB had the capacity to make decisions regarding her medical treatment. The other question was whether forced feeding would be in her best interests - while the doctors felt that it was not in her best interest, the matter had to be referred to the Court of Protection because the decision to terminate treatment would most likely end her life. 

On the first question of capcity, Roberts J held that while the preference to cease life-saving treatment was not indicative of incapacity in itself, the patient's decision making was sufficiently clouded by her disorder that she did not have capacity. She reasoned that the inconsistencies in her desire to live with her desire to cease treatment was an indication of incapcity.

On the question of best intersts, Roberts J noted the probability of the patient suffering physical and psychological harm as a result of forced feeding and thus concluded that palliative care, rather than forced-feeding, was in the best interests of the patient.
