Hi!

I am currently working as a Tutor in Law with <a href="https://oxfordtutors.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxford Tutors</a>, having graduated this year from the University of Oxford, with a <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/ba-jurisprudence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BA in Jurisprudence</a> (2.i). I am also studying <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/child-protection-childrens-rights-in-theory-and-pr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Childrenâ€™s Rights</a> with Harvard University (July - December 2020) and I will commence the <a href="https://www.icca.ac.uk/about-the-bar-course/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bar Practice Course</a> at the Inns of Court College of Advocacy in January 2021.

Previously, I have completed mini-pupillages with <a href="https://www.1cor.com/london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Crown Office Row</a>, <a href="https://www.guildhallchambers.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guildhall Chambers</a>, and <a href="https://www.trinitychambers.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trinity Chambers</a> and have also enjoyed work placements with <a href="https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/internship-experience-uk/law" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bright Network</a>, <a href="https://www.dentons.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dentons</a>, <a href="https://www.burnesspaull.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Burness Paull</a>, and <a href="https://www.linklaters.com/en/locations/united-kingdom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linklaters</a>. Additionally, in the <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/moot-pages-index/maitland-chambers-intercollegiate-cuppers-mooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maitland Chambers Mooting Competition</a>, I was half of the highest-scoring undergraduate pair, winning two rounds 10-0.

As well as having a passion for the practice of law in court, I have a passion for advocacy, academic research, and policy: I have previously volunteered with the <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citizens Advice Bureau</a> and <a href="https://www.scotcrn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottish Children's Research Network (University of Aberdeen)</a>, a charity centred around research and innovation in paediatric clinical trials, with focus on the legal and ethical implications of trials.

In my spare time, I study foreign languages and I am undertaking courses in history, classics, and literature.
